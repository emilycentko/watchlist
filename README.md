# WatchList

##Description & Background

WatchList is an application that helps authenticated users curate their own personal movie lists for themselves and others, much like creating various playlists for various moods, artists, and genres. 

I wanted to create an app that focused on personalized categorization and harkened back to the walls of “Staff Picks” and curated “Favorites” from local video rental stores. A user can create a watch list, give it a name, and simply start adding movies. These lists can be designated for certain friends, sorted by genre or director, never-before-seen, or seen time and time again. A user can also search for movies, edit a watch list name, delete a watch list, and delete a movie from a watch list.

A favorite pastime of mine is curating personalized watch lists and recommendations for friends based on what I think they would be interested in. This app could be built out to contain a friends feature to have more visibility between two or more users to expose them to even more movies.
